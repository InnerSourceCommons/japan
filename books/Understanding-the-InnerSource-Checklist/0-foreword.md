# Foreword

<!-- PayPal first spoke about its InnerSource journey at OSCON North America in 2015. We didn’t claim to have all the answers, just a will to experiment and openly report on our findings as we went about our journey to adopt open source methodologies within PayPal to reduce engineering silos and increase cross-stack collaboration. -->

<!-- A key part of our InnerSource journey has been building a team capable of designing tools and processes that can help us make this cultural shift. Silona Bonewald’s experience with open source and with product management along with her love of data science made her the ideal person to implement InnerSource across all of PayPal. -->

<!-- Silona likes order. She makes checklists to ensure that she doesn’t forget small details, but also to establish implementation norms and streamline adoption of new ideas. She’s written this booklet to share some of the thinking that went into our InnerSource Implementation Checklist. We hope you enjoy it and benefit from it. -->
