Chapter 7. From Internal Silos to Internal Transparency
=======================================================

TL;DR
=====

* Team divisions tend to create silos of information that hamper decision-making.
  
* Transparency can be reintroduced through rules about documenting activities and requirements for meetings on important decisions.
  
Where Did Silos Come From?
==========================

British anthropologist Robin Dunbar has proposed a theory that a social animal’s neocortex size limits that animal’s comfortable social group size. [Dunbar’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) suggests that humans are best able to handle approximately 150 relationships in a larger sense, and tend to maintain stronger ties to smaller groups of around 50.<sup>[1](#tbd)</sup> This maps back to tribes and their sizes. Many in the corporate world have noticed similar size limitations when creating organizational charts. Silos are a natural extension of those hierarchical situations. They also evolve out of specialization, and from these groupings tribal knowledge is born.

With silos, people do not need to care as much about consensus. They make communication and permissions easier because they divide people into smaller groups. And dividing people into assigned groups can make accountability easier. If something goes wrong with security, people can blame the security group.

What’s Wrong with Silos?
========================

As you can guess, communication between the silos can become difficult, and problems can cascade through the company. Communicating over a wall never has the same emotional impact on people. Getting things right matters more when you know one of the customer representatives personally and you hear his frustration when a bug you accidently created increases his call volume.

In the modern world of integrations and acquisitions, silos seriously hamper cross-team communications. Silos make the world of permissions a devastating morass of unproductivity as people swim upstream to find the tribal knowledge locked away in the silos. In really large enterprises, people attempt to diagram the convoluted jungle paths of interactivity and permissions via road maps. This is a losing battle because the vines continue to grow even as maps are drawn.

Transparency for Community Sourcing
===================================

Hopefully, by now you are convinced that transparency in coding has multiple benefits. But consider this, as well: transparency is a core tenet in science and academia. It is a key element in scientific rigor.<sup>[2](#tbd)</sup> We believe that it works within a company for the same reasons it works with academia. It improves collaboration, and empowers anyone within the company to see when a project is going off track and help to fix it.

Many businesses are learning the value of transparent communication with customers. Facebook, Twitter, and other forms of social media empower customers to get issues resolved publicly. Businesses have the opportunity to increase trust by handling problems effectively.<sup>[3](#tbd)</sup>

Transparency Boosts Decision-Making
===================================

Many organizations are seriously hampered because people can’t offer input to decisions that cross team boundaries. A staff member will say, “I don’t know what’s really going on in that group, so I can’t make a judgment.” The documentation and open meetings that this report proposes as part of the InnerSource culture will go a long way toward fixing this problem. People need three things to participate in decision-making: information (which documentation provides), access (which comes in meetings), and permission (which must become part of the InnerSource culture).

How Do We Break Down Silo Walls?
================================

If the problem with silos is that they impair communication and lock up tribal knowledge, the solution is to create processes that open communication channels and produce findable documentation.

Luckily, we can do both with the same processes, discussed in earlier chapters. All of the steps toward InnerSource are steps toward opening up the silos:

* Create new roles to take ownership of creating and maintaining documents that explicitly communicate expectations and needs, or assign this responsibility to existing roles. The roles should go to people most directly affected by the changes.
* Create processes that require inclusive, in-person meetings during the planning stages of integrations that are openly documented.
* Require discussions and announcements to use designated public channels.
* Make those channels accessible company-wide.
* Archive the discussions in a findable location.
  
There is a cost to making these changes. Projects might slow down as some people move into new roles and others adjust to more meetings and online discussions. But the benefits come quickly.

Findable Documentation Is Part of Transparency
==============================================

We as a society have become accustomed to using a search to find what we need. Filing email into folders is becoming obsolete; why spend time filing when you can just run a search? Yet finding necessary documentation in a company can feel more like a treasure hunt. One of our big goals is to improve documentation, and a major component of this is not just _creating_ it, but making it _findable_. Yes, documentation is an aspect of transparency.

Documentation in accessible and logical places becomes a major driver of transparency and collaboration. Creating documentation is usually a low priority and rarely has passionate champions, yet it can drastically shorten learning curves, ease collaboration, and prevent misunderstandings. Fortunately, InnerSource, when done correctly, creates extensive and findable documentation as a side effect.

As an enterprise transitions toward InnerSource, there is a time cost to the extra communication that is required. But if the enterprise first sets up passive documentation processes to capture this extra communication, that extra communication is a huge gain for future productivity. Learning from what worked and what didn’t is always useful for organizations, but most enterprises make no real effort to capture and share this knowledge. Sometimes, it is fear of liability, but if the conversations are done in a public fashion, people will already be aware of those repercussions and higher-quality conversations will ensue.

Look for ways to make passive documentation available to all levels in the company, not just developers in GitHub, email lists, or Slack conversations. Passive documentation reduces the barrier to nonwriters sharing knowledge precisely when it is needed. And by having the immediate feedback that passive documentation creates, questions are guaranteed to be answered well. Slack and other tools that allow more communication across silos have been extremely valuable in increasing collaboration.

Of course, there’s probably already some existing documentation scattered across the company. Many of our member organizations at the InnerSource Commons are looking at larger search solutions to make it easier to open information across departments and tools. Although their solutions don’t let people change or edit what they find in search (they must to return to the tool that created the information), they can at least find out what is happening and to whom to talk. Slack is proving very valuable in both facilitating and archiving those discussions on a wider scope.

It is also important for the enterprise to make collaboration a real priority. Communication costs will temporarily rise as the organization transitions. This is typical for in any change-management scenario. But communicating earlier during cross-team collaboration creates large productivity gains. Companies spend millions and millions on internal integrations and integrations of acquisitions. Having these conversations publicly facilitates the next acquisition or integration.

Where Do We Still Need to Improve Transparency?
===============================================

Those of us doing InnerSource already have code transparency through GitHub. We have taken the first steps to make planning and communications more transparent, but we still need to find more solutions in this area.

Often, tools themselves inhibit transparency across departments. When most enterprise software charges by the user, it becomes financially prohibitive to buy a user account for everyone in the company. A solution is to look primarily at tools that allow the company to become tools-agnostic through APIs. Many tools today have APIs, so you can use tools like Zapier and IFTTT to connect them.

What Are the Limits or Pitfalls in Enterprise Transparency?
===========================================================

There are hard limits to transparency in commercial enterprises, especially for publicly traded companies and international companies that need to worry about compliance issues with multiple governments. This is a significant difference from most open source organizations. Another important pitfall is handling remote access. Again, this is largely because of regulatory issues. When looking for technological solutions, you must keep these issues in mind.

Some enterprise agencies do look to open source organizations to help with global transparency when they are ready to become universally open. But when wading through the difficulties of being open within the company, while not violating laws about insider trading, they are on their own.

Still, the push to recover lost tribal knowledge, combined with the increased productivity and employee morale engendered by InnerSource, is convincing many enterprises that the price of transparency, even with all of these caveats, is a worthwhile endeavor.

There is also the topic of information overload and overcommunication. This is why search is a key element. We want to transition corporate culture from a push mentality, in which endless bulletins are sent out, to a pull mentality, in which people are confident that they will get the information they need when they need it via search.
