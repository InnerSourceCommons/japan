# Looking Forward

During our journey, we have found a need for many tools. Some help facilitate discussion and some help with standardization and compliance; others help with measurement and reporting. Please join us at [InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org/tools) where we are working on the open source versions of these tools.

One such tool is called Agora—for enterprise search. We are working toward an open system in which employees can easily add in diverse data sources. This will allow search across tools and domains.

We also are discussing maturity levels at the Commons. The first pass has been in regard to GitHub and GitLab metrics. But we would like to measure reuse and collaboration across data sources. However we can do this only if we first capture the data.

Creating an Industry Standard
=============================

We have created an organization called InnerSource Commons. Currently, we have more than 50 members, most from enterprise-sized organizations. One of our primary goals at the moment is to create an industry standard. We are working on creating pattern languages from stories that our members create.

We are spreading information in several ways:

* We are working with O’Reilly Media to create books (like this one) and training materials to help teach other people and their companies about InnerSource.
  
* We have classes based on ones we’ve given at conferences, now trimmed to fit in 30-minute segments.
  
* We have [training materials on the wiki](http://www.innersourcecommons.org/training). If you have any feedback or create any materials that you want to share, please contact us there or follow the link to our Slack chat channel.
  
**InnerSource Pattern Language**

One very large-scale project under way at the Commons is creating a pattern language for finding solutions to problems. Leonardo da Vinci looked to nature for solutions to difficult problems. When _we_ encounter a difficult problem, we look to an open source collection of previously solved problems that have a pattern similar to ours. In the pattern project, we create simple patterns that contain five elements:

* A description of the problem
* The larger context around the problem
* The forces that must be considered in finding a solution
* A possible solution
* The new context that results from applying the solution
  
Thankfully, the many similar (and already documented!) [patterns](http://www.innersourcecommons.org/patterns) in the open source world are making quick work of this project.
