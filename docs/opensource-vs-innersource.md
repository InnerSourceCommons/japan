# InnerSource 
 <!-- Open Source Software is software whose copyright allows anyone to use, study, change and develop the source code for any purpose. Since open source projects (OSS projects) are managed in many different ways, the following 6 points represent basic principles that can be found in the majority of long-term successful projects. Open source principles can also be used profitably in purely internal product development - but then in the form of [InnerSource](https://innersourcecommons.org/) projects.  -->
  
 <!-- The following overview presents principles of InnerSource projects in companies.  -->
  
  
 ## As a baseline, code must be transparently hosted within the organization 
  
 <!-- Project artefacts (source code, documentation, etc.) are publicly available throughout the company and easy to find. There should be as few barriers as possible to becoming active in a project yourself.  -->
  
 ## Contributions over feature requests 
  
 <!-- All stakeholders of a product see themselves as potential contributors and are treated as such by the project. In terms of meritocracy, the assumption is that "good contributions can come from anywhere".  -->
  
 <!-- Contributions remain suggestions, not mandatory requirements. Therefore, a short conversation is worthwhile before starting an implementation. 
 The rules of the game for participation in the project are deposited openly and are binding for participation.  -->
  
 ## Written over verbal communication 
  
 <!-- It should be possible to participate in a project asynchronously. This requires written communication. It must be possible to participate in project-relevant decisions throughout the company; for this, it is necessary to make these decisions in writing.  -->
  
 <!-- Project-relevant communication that does not take place via the main communication channel of the project must be summarised on this channel at least in the follow-up. In this way, relevant communication can be read by all staff members and traced at a later date. As a by-product, this creates passive documentation of the project history that can also be comprehended by newcomers. Particularly in the case of personnel decisions, care should be taken to ensure that they are made as private as necessary and as public as possible. 
 Exceptions concern, among other things, security-relevant discussions or personnel communication.  -->
  
 <!-- The advantages of asynchronous working must be weighed against the loss of speed and communication bandwidth that occurs with this way of working. Written summaries of synchronous meetings can be a middle ground.  -->
  
 ## Reward trusted committership 
  
 <!-- With predominantly written, archived communication, mistakes can no longer be erased but remain potentially forever available for reading throughout the company. This makes it all the more important to create a culture in which learning is welcomed and mistakes are perceived as an opportunity for improvement. 
 All contributions (including source code, documentation, bug reports, constructive discussion, marketing, user support) are valued and commitment to a project is rewarded: those who show commitment to a project are invited as new "trusted committers". All members of a project are visible to all staff members.  -->
  
 ## Allow written advice to accrete in a persistent, searchable archive 
  
 <!-- Each project should develop an independent project memory. This is a central, company-wide open archive in which all project-relevant decisions, design documents and other artefacts are collected. All communication can be referenced via stable (non-changing) URLs and can be found, searched and accessed by every employee.  -->
